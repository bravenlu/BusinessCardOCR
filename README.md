#Business-Card-OCR
In order to run the Business Card OCR application, please clone the respository and change to the 'asymmetrik' folder within the Business Card OCR directory through a terminal window. After changing to that folder, you should be able to see the 'BCO.java' file. Once you are able to see the file, from the terminal, run the command 'java asymmetrik.BCO'. Once executed a GUI should appear on your screen in which you will be able to paste your business card input into the terminal provided. After pressing submit on the GUI, it should provide you with your desired output.
